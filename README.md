# Machine learning fundamentals and hands-on

The course "Machine learning fundamentals", is part of the ICTP-International Workshop on Machine Learning for Space Weather: Fundamentals, Tools and Future Prospects | (smr 3750) Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2022. (https://indico.ictp.it/event/9840/)



# Description of the course
The course was developed specially for the scientific community with the objective of showing different concepts and techniques of Machine Learning an these application on some scenarios of Space Weather.

# Which are the topics of the course?
The course is divided in two parts: the [lectures](https://github.com/Laboratorio-Computacion-Cientifica/International-Workshop-on-Machine-Learning-for-Space-Weather-Fundamentals-Tools-and-Future-Prospects/tree/main/lectures) and the [hands-on sessions](https://github.com/Laboratorio-Computacion-Cientifica/International-Workshop-on-Machine-Learning-for-Space-Weather-Fundamentals-Tools-and-Future-Prospects/tree/main/hands-on-sessions).

In this course you'll to learn about:

- Data Science pipeline used in general in the projects
- Machine Learning (ML)
  - What is Machine Learning?
  - What is a ML-based modeling?
  - Why we can apply ML in SWx?
  - Basic concepts of ML
    - Hiperparameters of a ML techniques (activation funciton, loss function, epochs, batch size, etc)
    - Loss function (in classification and forecasting)
    - Overfiting, underfiting, ideal fit!
    - How to messure the performance of the models? (Metrics)
  - Concepts of techniques for classification, forecasting and clustering
    - Artificial neural networks (ANN)
    - Deep learning (DL)
